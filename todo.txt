- for FFA rotational symmetry, add a big crater in the center w/ lots of metal & a geo?
- add second set of precalc start boxes that's more toward the corners, to prevent opposite allyteam starts from being right next to each other
- remove shitty binding Meteor.mirrorMeteor and World.mirror code. only useful in thatsamore, and there not much.
- fix meteor shower min diameter (or remove)
- find a way to get a new random seed every game?
	- generate the map at gadget:GameID() and use gameID string to make a randomseed
	- give each team a unit with infinite LOS, then remove it once the map is generated
