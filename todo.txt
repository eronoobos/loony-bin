- do rotational symmetry for odd numbers of allyteams:
	- instead of random position, starts are a random CirclePos, limited to smallest map dimension minus startRadius radius
	- instead of startboxes, allyteams get two angles
- add second set of precalc start boxes that's more toward the corners, to prevent opposite allyteam starts from being right next to each other
- clean up mirroring code in loony.lua
- fix meteor shower min and max diameter
- find a way to get a new random seed every game?
