- create or find better detailtex
- place ground decals on top of geothermals?
- map option for random key
- fix random variation of mirrored meteors (should not be multiplicative)
- idea for metal spots: bring back non-reclaimable features, but make them disappear if a building is on top of them, and reappear when it's gone
- sprinkle some randomly placed, reclaimable, easily distinguishable rocks around the map
- provide start locations (is this possible?)
