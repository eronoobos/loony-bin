- fix meteor shower min and max diameter
- create or find better detailtex
- sprinkle some randomly placed, reclaimable, easily distinguishable rocks around the map
- find a way to get a new random seed every game?
- idea for metal spots: bring back non-reclaimable features, but make them disappear if a building is on top of them, and reappear when it's gone. might be a bad idea though, because players will expect the rocks to be reclaimable
