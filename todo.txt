- switch from setting water level to setting a relative water level, so it's easy to set if the craters are ponds, if there's no water, or if the whole map is water
- improve entry/exit ramps?
- place features on top of metal spots and/or ground decals
- place features and/or ground decals on top of geothermals
- give map a texture (sand?)
- provide start locations (is this possible?)
