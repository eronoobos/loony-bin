- fix meteor shower min and max diameter
- create or find better detailtex
- use something other than a giant decal for blastrays (it's SLOWWW)
- idea for metal spots: bring back non-reclaimable features, but make them disappear if a building is on top of them, and reappear when it's gone
- sprinkle some randomly placed, reclaimable, easily distinguishable rocks around the map
- find a way to get a new random seed every game?
- provide start locations (is this possible?)
	- or have fixed start locations that always have a crater with three metal spots on each
