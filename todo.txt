- improve start crater locations for large allyteams by using corners and finally center of picky startbox
- remove shitty binding Meteor.mirrorMeteor and World.mirror code. only useful in thatsamore, and there not much.
- fix meteor shower min diameter (or remove)
- possible to give a progress bar by sending messages back and forth (gadget does new render frame when it receives a message from a widget that the last progress report was received by someone). but then the game starts before the map is done rendering... it's a mess
